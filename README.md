Hello and welcome to my personal site! All content published here represents my academic projects and/or independent work.

### About Me 

#### B.S. in Statistics, Minor in Computer Science @ UC Davis


Most recently, I worked as a Bioinformatics [Researcher/Intern](http://michelmorelab.ucdavis.edu/member_page.php?id=170) at the UC Davis Genome Center. Generally my work revolved around Bash/Python/R scripting, genomic analysis, and statistical computing. 


As of now, I am pursuing a full-time Data Science or Analyst role within California.
