### About Me
Undergraduate Statistics student at UC Davis. 

I've been diving into a lot of statistical computing here because of my interests in _Bioinformatics_.  I'm very grateful for the oppourtunity to study here, as I seem to learn something amazing every week. I hope that the content I post on this site can inspire others as well.
