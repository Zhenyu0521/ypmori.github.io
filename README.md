# Yuji Mori 

Hello and welcome to my personal site! All content published here represents my academic projects and/or independent work.

### About Me 

#### B.S. in Statistics, Minor in Computer Science @ UC Davis

As of now, I am pursuing a full-time Data Science or Analyst role within California.

Most recently, I worked as a Bioinformatics [Researcher/Intern](http://michelmorelab.ucdavis.edu/member_page.php?id=170) at the UC Davis Genome Center. Generally my work revolved around Bash/Python/R scripting, genomic analysis, and statistical computing. Check out my research poster [here](https://ypmori.github.io/URC_Poster_Submission_Mori.pdf).
